# How to create a global header and footer using PHP include? (Example) 

## Step 1: Create the Header File

- Create a new PHP file called `header.php`.
- In this file, write the HTML code that you want to include in the header of every page.

```php
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Your Website Title</title>
    <!-- Add your CSS, JavaScript, etc. here -->
</head>
<body>
    <header>
        <!-- Your header content goes here -->
    </header>

```

## Step 2: Create the Footer File

- Create another new PHP file called `footer.php`.
- In this file, write the HTML code that you want to include in the footer of every page.
```php
    <footer>
        <!-- Your footer content goes here -->
    </footer>
</body>
</html>

```

## Step 3:  Include the Header and Footer in Your Pages

- Now, in each of your website’s pages, you can include the header and footer files at the beginning and end of the page respectively.
```php
<?php include 'header.php'; ?>

<!-- Your page content goes here -->

<?php include 'footer.php'; ?>
```

> This way, the header and footer will be included on every page where you include these files. This is a simple and effective way to maintain universal header and footer across your website. Remember to replace `header.php` and `footer.php` with the correct path to your header and footer files if they are located in different directories.
