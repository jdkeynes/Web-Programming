# Exercise 4: Control flow and loops 

1. **Create a file (ex4.php)**: Create a file named ex4.php in your exercise folder. Ensure that it uses the same layout as your other pages and that your navigation bar includes a link to this exercise.
2. **If-Else**: Write a PHP script to get inputs (age and name) from the user and based on their age, decide if he/she is eligible for voting. (18 or more than 18 years is eligible for voting, use form to get user input).
3. **Switch Case**: Write a PHP script that gets the current month and prints one of the following responses, depending on whether it's August or not:<br><br>
            It's August, so it's still holiday.<br>
            Not August, this is Month-name so I don't have any holidays<br>
    > Hint: You can use date(F) function to get the current month name. Check Date function from the php manual page.
4. **For Loop**: Write a PHP script that will print the multiplication table of a number (n, use form to get user input).
5. **While Loop**: Write a PHP script that will print all the numbers from 1 to n. (use form to get user input)
6. **Foreach Loop**: Write a PHP script that will print all the elements of an array. `$myarray=("HTML", "CSS", "PHP", "JavaScript")`.
